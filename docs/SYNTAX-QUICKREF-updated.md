# Nimtalk Syntax Quick Reference - Object Model & Parsing

## Instance Variable Declaration

### Class with Declared Instance Variables
```smalltalk
"Declare instance variables when creating class
"derive: is a regular message, not special syntax"
"Symbols in arrays need # prefix: #(#name #age)"
Person := Object derive: #(#name #age)

# Create and initialize instance
person := Person new.
person name: 'Alice'              # Uses generated setter (direct slot access)
person age: 30

# Access ivars
result := person name               # Uses generated getter (direct slot access)
```

## Inheritance

```smalltalk
# Single inheritance
Employee := Person derive: #(#salary #department)

# Multi-level inheritance
Manager := Employee derive: #(#teamSize)

# Multiple inheritance (traits pattern)
Enumerable := Object derive: #().
Employee := Person derive: #(#salary) withParents: #(Enumerable)
```

## Method Definition Syntax (File Format)

### Standard Syntax (REPL/Interactive)
```smalltalk
# Normal executable code - works in REPL
Person selector: #greet put: [ ^ 'Hello, ' , name ]
```

### Definition Syntax (Files Only - SPECIAL PARSING)
```smalltalk
"This syntax requires special parsing" - NOT executable in REPL
"Use in .nt files for class definitions

"Unary" method (no parameters)
Person>>greet [ ^ 'Hello, ' , name ]

# Method with one parameter
Person>>name: aName [ name := aName ]

# Method with multiple parameters
Person>>moveX: dx y: dy [
  x := x + dx
  y := y + dy
]

# Method with comment and validation
Person>>age: anAge [
  | age |
  'Validate age is positive'
  (anAge >= 0) ifFalse: [ Error signal: 'Age must be positive' ].
  age := anAge
]

# Multiple methods (no trailing periods needed)
Person>>name [ ^ name ]

Person>>age [ ^ age ]

Person>>description [
  ^ name , " (age " , age asString , ")"
]
```

**Note**: The closing `]` acts as the terminator. No trailing period needed!
**Note**: Temporary variables (`| temp1 temp2 |`) must come BEFORE any statement comment strings.

**Note on `super`**: Use `super` to call parent methods. Inside a method, `super` refers to the parent of the class where the method was defined, enabling proper inheritance chaining.

### Why Two Syntaxes?

**REPL Mode** - Standard message passing:
```
Parser sees: Person at: "greet" put: [ ... ]
        ↓
Executes: Send 'at:put:' message to Person
```

**File Definition Mode** - Special parsing with `>>`:
```
Parser sees: Person>>greet [ ... ]
        ↓
Recognizes: Method definition syntax
        ↓
Converts to: Person at: "greet" put: [ ... ]
        ↓
Executes: Same as standard message send
```

Both `self` and `super` are available inside methods:
- `self` - The receiver of the message (dynamic dispatch from receiver's class)
- `super` - Lookup method in parent class (unqualified uses first parent, qualified uses explicit parent)

### Super Send Examples
```smalltalk
# Unqualified super (uses first parent)
Employee>>calculatePay [
    base := super calculatePay.
    ^ base + self bonus
]

# Qualified super (explicit parent selection)
Employee>>calculatePay [
    base := super<Person> calculatePay.
    ^ base + self bonus
]
```

## Message Sending

### Current Way (Works Everywhere)
```smalltalk
"Property bag access (deprecated for declared classs)
obj at: "property"                        # Get
obj at: "property" put: value             # Set

# Dynamic method invocation
obj perform: "methodName"                 # Call method
obj perform: "method:with:" with: args     # Call with args
```

### New Way (Declared Classs)
```smalltalk
"Generated accessor methods (compile to direct slot access)"
person name                                 # Getter - direct read
person name: 'Alice'                      # Setter - direct write

"Standard message sending (always available)"
person greet                              "Unary" message
3 + 4                                     "Binary" message
person at: #key put: "value"           "Keyword" (for collections)
```

### Direct Ivar Access (Inside Methods)
```smalltalk
# Inside method bodies, access ivars directly
Person>>greet [
  ^ 'Hello, ' , name                    "Direct slot access"
]

Person>>birthday [
  | age |
  age := age + 1                        "Direct read and write"
  ^ self
]
```

## Initialization

```smalltalk
Person>>initialize [
  name := 'Anonymous'                   "Direct ivar assignment"
  age := 0
]

# Usage
person := Person derive initialize.     "Create then init"ialize
person name: 'Alice'                    "Then configure"

# Or use class-side constructor
Person>>newWithName: aName age: anAge [
  ^ self derive initialize
      name: aName;                      "Cascade messages"
      age: anAge;
      yourself
]

# Usage
person := Person newWithName: 'Alice' age: 30
```

## Inheritance and Super

```smalltalk
Employee>>initialize [
  super initialize.                     "Call parent initialization"
  salary := 0.0                         "Then init Employee ivars"
]

Employee>>greet [
  'Override parent method, call super for base behavior'
  ^ super greet , ' from ' , department
]
```

The `super` keyword refers to the parent of the class where the current method was defined. This ensures that when you override a method, you can call the parent implementation using `super methodName`.

## File Structure by Convention

```
"One class per file (recommended)
src/
  models/
    Person.nt            "Defines Person class"
    Employee.nt          # Defines Employee
    Company.nt           # Defines Company
  main.nt                # Application entry point

"Multi-class files also supported
src/
  models.nt              # Person, Employee, Company all defined here
```

## Parsing Modes

### REPL/Interactive Mode
```smalltalk
# Standard message passing - everything executes immediately
> Person := Object derive: #(#name)
> Person at: "name:" put: [ :n | name := n ]
> person := Person derive initialize
> person name: 'Alice'
```

### File Definition Mode
```smalltalk
# File: src/models/Person.nt
# Special parsing for method definitions

Person := Object derive: #(#name #age)                    # Executable

Person>>initialize [                                    # Method definition
  | name age |
  name := 'Anonymous'.
  age := 0
]

Person>>name: aName [                                   # Method definition
  name := aName
]
```

## Standard Types Provided

```smalltalk
"Object - Root class (all objects inherit from this)
obj := Object derive.

"String, Number, Boolean - Built-in types
'hello world'           # String (double-quoted)
42                      # Integer
3.14                    # Float
true/false              # Boolean

"Multiline strings (like Nim)
""
This is a multiline string
It can span multiple lines
"""

# Characters (single-quoted, single character)
#'a'                    # Character symbol
#'newline'              # Newline symbol
#'tab'                  # Tab symbol

# Collections
#(1 2 3)                "Array literal (ordered)
#{"key" -> "value"}    "Table literal (dictionary)

# Collection access
arr at: 2              "Get element from array (1-based indexing)
tab at: "key"          "Get value from table
```

## Control Flow

```smalltalk
"Conditional (messages to boolean objects)
(x > 0) ifTrue: [ 'positive' ] ifFalse: [ 'negative' ]

"Looping
[ x < 10 ] whileTrue: [ x := x + 1 ]

"Collection iteration
numbers do: [ :each | each print ]
numbers select: [ :each | each > 5 ]
numbers collect: [ :each | each * 2 ]

# Multiline keyword messages (no period needed between lines)
tags isNil
  ifTrue: [ ^ 'Object' ]
  ifFalse: [ ^ tags first ]
```

See [NEWLINE_RULES.md](NEWLINE_RULES.md) for complete newline handling rules.

  temp1 := 1.
  temp2 := 2
]                                            # Block with temps (no params)

[ :x | temp |
  temp := x * 2.

a >= b                                      # Greater than or equal
a // b                                      # Integer division
a \ b                                       # Modulo
a ~~ b                                      # Not identity
```

## Method Definition Approaches

Nimtalk supports multiple approaches for defining methods:

### Approach 1: Individual Definition (>> syntax)
```smalltalk
# In .nt files only - transformed by parser
Person>>greet [ ^ 'Hello, ' , name ]
Person>>name: aName [ name := aName ]
```

### Approach 2: Batched Definition (extend:)
```smalltalk
# Works in both files and REPL
Person extend: [
  self >> greet [ ^ 'Hello, ' , name ].
  self >> name: aName [ name := aName ].
  self >> printString [ ^ name ]
]
```

### Approach 3: Combined Creation (derive:methods:)
```smalltalk
# Create class with ivars AND methods in one expression
Person := Object derive: #(name age) methods: [
  self >> greet [ ^ "Hello, I am " , name ].
  self >> haveBirthday [ age := age + 1 ]
]
```

### Approach 4: Class-side Methods (extendClass:)
```smalltalk
# Factory methods on the class object
Person extendClass: [
  self >> newNamed: n aged: a [
    | person |
    person := self derive.
    person name: n.
    person age: a.
    ^ person
  ]
]

# Usage
p := Person newNamed: 'Alice' aged: 30
```

### Dynamic Message Sending (perform:)
```smalltalk
# Send message dynamically using symbols
obj perform: #methodName
obj perform: #method: with: arg
obj perform: #method:with: with: arg1 with: arg2

# Get all methods or properties
obj methods        # Returns array of symbols
obj properties     # Returns array of symbols
```

## Key Differences Summary

1. **String Literals**: Use `"double quotes"` only - single quotes are reserved
2. **Symbol Literals**: Use `#symbol` for selectors and keys
3. **Ivar Declaration**: `derive: #(#ivar1 #ivar2)` for declared instance variables
4. **Method Definitions**: `>>` syntax in files, `at:put:` in REPL, `extend:` in both
5. **No Trailing Periods**: After method definitions (closing `]` is terminator)
6. **Direct Access**: Inside methods, access ivars directly by name
7. **Accessor Methods**: Used outside methods, compile to direct access
8. **Temporary Variables**: Must be first in block after `[` before any comments
9. **Multiline Keywords**: Keyword messages can span lines without periods

## Additional Features Implemented

### Multi-Character Binary Operators

Nimtalk supports multi-character binary operators, matched longest-first:

```smalltalk
a == b      # Equality comparison
a ~= b      # Not equal
a <= b      # Less than or equal
a >= b      # Greater than or equal
a // b      # Integer division (double slash)
a \ b       # Modulo (single backslash)
a ~~ b      # Not identity
```

### Cascading Messages

Nimtalk supports Smalltalk's cascade syntax using `;` to send multiple messages to the same receiver:

```smalltalk
# Send multiple messages to the same object
obj at: #x put: 0; at: #y put: 0; at: #z put: 0

# Works with any message type
calculator clear; add: 5; add: 10; result

# Receiver is evaluated only once
counter increment; increment; increment
```

### Implementation Note

**File syntax (`>>`)**: The `>>` syntax for method definitions in files is now fully implemented. You can use either syntax:

```smalltalk
# New way (cleaner, file-only)
Person>>greet: name [ ^ "Hello " , name ]

"Standard way" (works in REPL and files)
Person at: #greet: put: [ :name | ^ "Hello " , name ]
```

The `>>` syntax is transformed by the parser into the standard `at:put:` message send, so both approaches are functionally equivalent.
