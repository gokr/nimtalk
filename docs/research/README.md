# Nemo Research and Historical Documents

This directory contains historical design documents, implementation plans, and research notes from Nemo's development. These documents are kept for reference but may not reflect the current implementation.

## Contents

### Design Proposals

- **[NIMTALK-NEW-OBJECT-MODEL.md](NIMTALK-NEW-OBJECT-MODEL.md)** - Summary of the new object model design
- **[CLASSES-AND-INSTANCES.md](CLASSES-AND-INSTANCES.md)** - Design exploration of class-like conventions

### Implementation Plans

- **[IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md](IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md)** - Detailed 6-week implementation plan (all phases completed)
- **[DECISION-NEEDED.md](DECISION-NEEDED.md)** - Design decision records from early development

## Note on Currency

These documents represent historical design work. For the current implementation:

- See [docs/SYNTAX-QUICKREF-updated.md](../SYNTAX-QUICKREF-updated.md) for current syntax
- See [docs/SPECIFICATION.md](../SPECIFICATION.md) for language specification
- See [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) for development guidelines
