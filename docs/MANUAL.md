## Introduction

Harding is a class-based Smalltalk dialect that compiles to Nim. It preserves Smalltalk's message-passing semantics and syntax while making pragmatic changes for a modern implementation.

### Key Features

- **Class-based object system** with multiple inheritance
- **Message-passing semantics** (unary, binary, keyword)
- **Block closures** with lexical scoping and non-local returns
- **Direct slot access** for declared instance variables (O(1) access)
- **Method definition syntax** using `>>` operator
- **Libraries** for namespace isolation and modular code organization
- **Green threads** for cooperative multitasking
- **Nim integration** via primitive syntax

### Quick Comparison with Smalltalk-80

| Feature | Smalltalk-80 | Harding |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Object model | Classes + metaclasses | Classes only (no metaclasses) |
| Statement separator | Period (`.`) only | Period or newline |
| String quotes | Single quote (`'`) | Double quote (`"`) only |
| Class methods | Metaclass methods | Methods on class object |
| Class variables | Shared class state | Not implemented |
| Instance variables | Named slots | Indexed slots (faster) |
| Multiple inheritance | Single only | Multiple with conflict detection |
| Primitives | VM-specific | Nim code embedding |
| nil | Primitive value | Instance of UndefinedObject class |

---

## Lexical Structure

### Literals

```smalltalk
42                  # Integer
3.14                # Float
"hello"             # String (double quotes only)
#symbol             # Symbol
#(1 2 3)            # Array
#{"key" -> "value"} # Table (dictionary)
```

### Comments

```smalltalk
# This is a comment
#==== Section header
```

**Note**: Hash `#` followed by whitespace or special characters marks a comment. Double quotes are for strings, not comments.

### Symbol Literals

```smalltalk
#symbol         # Simple symbol
#at:put:        # Keyword symbol
#"with spaces"  # Symbol with spaces (double quotes)
```

### Shebang Support

Harding scripts can include shebang lines at the beginning:

```smalltalk
#!/usr/bin/env harding
# This script can be made executable and run directly
```

When the kernel executes the script, the shebang line is automatically skipped by the lexer.

### Statement Separation

Harding takes a pragmatic approach to statement separation:

```smalltalk
# Periods work (Smalltalk-compatible)
x := 1.
y := 2.

# Line endings also work (Harding-style)
x := 1
y := 2

# Mixed style is fine
x := 1.
y := 2
z := x + y.
```

**Multiline keyword messages** can span multiple lines while forming a single statement:

```smalltalk
tags isNil
  ifTrue: [ ^ "Object" ]
  ifFalse: [ ^ tags first ]
```

This is parsed as: `tags isNil ifTrue: [...] ifFalse: [...]` - a single statement.

### Where Newlines Are NOT Allowed

| Construct | Multiline? | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Binary operators | No | `x` followed by newline then `+ y` fails |
| Unary message chains | No | `obj` followed by newline then `msg` fails |
| Method selectors | No | `Class>>` followed by newline then `selector` fails |
| Keyword message chain | Yes | `obj msg1: a\n msg2: b` works |
| Statement separator | Yes | `x := 1\ny := 2` works |

---

## Script Files

Harding scripts are stored in `.hrd` or `.harding` files and executed with:

```bash
harding script.hrd
```

### Temporary Variables in Scripts

Scripts are automatically wrapped in a block, enabling Smalltalk-style temporary variable declarations at the file level:

```smalltalk
# script.hrd
| counter total |
counter := 0
total := 0
1 to: 5 do: [:i |
  counter := counter + 1
  total := total + i
]
total  "Returns 15"
```

This eliminates the need to use uppercase global variables (`Counter`, `Total`) for simple scripts.

### Execution Context

Script blocks execute with `self = nil`, following the Smalltalk workspace convention (like a do-it in a Workspace). This provides consistent behavior between the REPL and script execution.

```
# In script.hrd or REPL do-it:
self printString  "Returns: 'an UndefinedObject'"
self isNil         "Returns: true"
```

### Shebang Support

Scripts can be made executable with a shebang line:

```smalltalk
#!/usr/bin/env harding
| sum |
sum := 0
1 to: 100 do: [:i | sum := sum + i]
sum
```

```bash
chmod +x script.hrd
./script.hrd
```

---

## Object System

### Creating Classes

```smalltalk
# Create a class with instance variables (no accessors)
Point := Object derive: #(x y)

# Create a class with automatic accessors
Person := Object deriveWithAccessors: #(name age)

# Create a class with selective accessors
Account := Object derive: #(balance owner)
                       getters: #(balance owner)
                       setters: #(balance)

# Create an instance
p := Point new
p x: 100
p y: 200
```

### Instance Variables

Instance variables declared with `derive:` are accessed by name within methods:

```smalltalk
Point>>moveBy: dx and: dy [
    x := x + dx      # Direct slot access
    y := y + dy
    ^ self
]
```

### Automatic Accessor Generation

Harding provides convenience methods for generating getters and setters automatically:

#### `deriveWithAccessors:`

Creates a class and auto-generates both getters and setters for all slots:

```smalltalk
Person := Object deriveWithAccessors: #(name age)
p := Person new
p name: "Alice"    # Auto-generated setter
p age: 30          # Auto-generated setter
p name             # Auto-generated getter - returns "Alice"
p age              # Auto-generated getter - returns 30
```

For each slot `x`, two methods are generated:
- `x` - Getter method that returns the slot value
- `x:` - Setter method that takes one argument and assigns it to the slot

#### `derive:getters:setters:`

Creates a class with selective accessor generation:

```smalltalk
# Generate getters for both slots, but setter only for 'name'
Person := Object derive: #(name age)
                       getters: #(name age)
                       setters: #(name)

p := Person new
p name: "Alice"    # Works - setter generated
p name             # Works - getter generated, returns "Alice"
p age              # Works - getter generated, returns nil
p age: 30          # Error - no setter generated for 'age'
```

This is useful when you want:
- Read-only slots (include in getters but not setters)
- Write-only slots (include in setters but not getters)
- Public getters with private setters (convention: only generate setters for internal use)

#### Performance

Generated accessors use `SlotAccessNode` for O(1) direct slot access:
- Getter: Direct slot read by index
- Setter: Direct slot write by index

This provides the same performance as manually written accessor methods that use direct slot access.

### Inheritance

```smalltalk
# Single inheritance
ColoredPoint := Point derive: #(color)

# Multi-level inheritance
Shape3D := ColoredPoint derive: #(depth)
```

### Direct Slot Access

Inside methods, instance variables are accessed directly by name. This provides O(1) performance compared to named property access.

Performance comparison (per 100k ops):
- Direct slot access: ~0.8ms
- Named slot access: ~67ms
- Property bag access: ~119ms

Slot-based access is **149x faster** than property bag access.

---

## Multiple Inheritance

### Adding Parents

A class can have multiple parent classes:

```smalltalk
# Create two parent classes
Parent1 := Object derive: #(a)
Parent1 >> foo [ ^ "foo1" ]

Parent2 := Object derive: #(b)
Parent2 >> bar [ ^ "bar2" ]

# Create a child that inherits from both
Child := Object derive: #(x)
Child addParent: Parent1
Child addParent: Parent2

# Child now has access to both foo and bar
c := Child new
c foo  # Returns "foo1"
c bar  # Returns "bar2"
```

### Conflict Detection

When adding multiple parents (via `derive:` with multiple parents or `addParent:`), Harding checks for:

**Slot name conflicts**: If any slot name exists in multiple parent hierarchies, an error is raised.

```smalltalk
Parent1 := Object derive: #(shared)
Parent2 := Object derive: #(shared)

Child := Object derive: #(x)
Child addParent: Parent1
Child addParent: Parent2  # Error: Slot name conflict
```

**Method selector conflicts**: If directly-defined method selectors conflict between parents, an error is raised.

```smalltalk
Parent1 := Object derive: #(a)
Parent1 >> foo [ ^ "foo1" ]

Parent2 := Object derive: #(b)
Parent2 >> foo [ ^ "foo2" ]

Child := Object derive: #(x)
Child addParent: Parent1
Child addParent: Parent2  # Error: Method selector conflict
```

### Resolving Conflicts

To work with conflicting parent methods, override the method in the child class first, then use `addParent:`:

```smalltalk
Parent1 := Object derive: #(a)
Parent1 >> foo [ ^ "foo1" ]

Parent2 := Object derive: #(b)
Parent2 >> foo [ ^ "foo2" ]

# Create child with override first
Child := Object derive: #(x)
Child >> foo [ ^ "child" ]

# Add conflicting parents - works because child overrides
Child addParent: Parent1
Child addParent: Parent2

(Child new foo)  # Returns "child"
```

**Note**: Only directly-defined methods on each parent are checked for conflicts. Inherited methods (like `derive:` from Object) will not cause false conflicts.

### Super Sends

Harding supports both qualified and unqualified super sends for multiple inheritance:

```smalltalk
# Unqualified super (uses first parent)
Employee>>calculatePay [
    base := super calculatePay.
    ^ base + bonus
]

# Qualified super (explicit parent selection)
Employee>>calculatePay [
    base := super<Person> calculatePay.
    ^ base + bonus
]
```

---

## Methods and Message Sending

### Method Definition (>> Syntax)

```smalltalk
# Unary method
Person>>greet [ ^ "Hello, " , name ]

# Method with one parameter
Person>>name: aName [ name := aName ]

# Method with multiple keyword parameters
Point>>moveX: dx y: dy [
  x := x + dx.
  y := y + dy.
  ^ self
]
```

### Method Batching (extend:)

Define multiple methods in a single block:

```smalltalk
Person extend: [
  self >> greet [ ^ "Hello, " , name ].
  self >> name: aName [ name := aName ].
  self >> haveBirthday [ age := age + 1 ]
]
```

### Class-side Methods (extendClass:)

Define factory methods on the class object:

```smalltalk
Person extendClass: [
  self >> newNamed: n aged: a [
    | person |
    person := self derive.
    person name: n.
    person age: a.
    ^ person
  ]
]

# Usage
p := Person newNamed: "Alice" aged: 30
```

### Combined Class Creation (derive:methods:)

Create a class with instance variables AND define methods in one expression:

```smalltalk
Person := Object derive: #(name age) methods: [
  self >> greet [ ^ "Hello, I am " , name ].
  self >> haveBirthday [ age := age + 1 ]
]
```

### Message Sending

```smalltalk
# Unary (no arguments)
obj size
obj class

# Binary (one argument, operator)
3 + 4
5 > 3
"a" , "b"          # String concatenation

# Keyword (one or more arguments)
dict at: key put: value
obj moveBy: 10 and: 20
```

### Cascading

Send multiple messages to the same receiver:

```smalltalk
obj
  at: #x put: 0;
  at: #y put: 0;
  at: #z put: 0
```

### Return Values

Use `^` (caret) to return a value:

```smalltalk
Point>>x [ ^ x ]
```

If no `^` is used, the method returns `self`.

### Dynamic Message Sending (perform:)

Send messages dynamically using symbols:

```smalltalk
obj perform: #clone                    # Same as: obj clone
obj perform: #at:put: with: #x with: 5  # Same as: obj at: #x put: 5
```

---

## Blocks and Closures

### Basic Syntax

```smalltalk
# Block with no parameters
[ statements ]

# Block with parameters
[ :param | param + 1 ]

# Block with temporaries
[ | temp1 temp2 |
  temp1 := 1.
  temp2 := temp1 + 1 ].

# Block with parameters and temporaries
[ :param1 :param2 | temp1 temp2 | code ]
```

The `|` separator marks the boundary between parameters/temporaries and the body.

**Harding-specific feature**: Unlike most Smalltalk implementations, Harding allows you to omit the `|` when a block has parameters but no temporaries:

```smalltalk
# Harding - valid and concise
[ :x | x * 2 ]

# Traditional style also works
[ :x | | x * 2 ]
```

### Lexical Scoping

Blocks capture variables from their enclosing scope:

```smalltalk
value := 10
block := [ value + 1 ]  # Captures 'value'
block value             # Returns 11
```

### Mutable Shared State

Blocks that capture the same variable share access to it:

```smalltalk
makeCounter := [ |
  count := 0.
  ^[ count := count + 1. ^count ]
].

counter := makeCounter value.
counter value.  # Returns 1
counter value.  # Returns 2
counter value.  # Returns 3
```

### Block Invocation

Blocks are invoked via the `value:` message family:

- `value` - invoke with no arguments
- `value:` - invoke with 1 argument
- `value:value:` - invoke with 2 arguments
- etc.

### Non-Local Returns

Use `^` within a block to return from the enclosing method:

```smalltalk
findFirst: [ :arr :predicate |
  1 to: arr do: [ :i |
    elem := arr at: i.
    (predicate value: elem) ifTrue: [ ^elem ]  "Returns from findFirst:"
  ].
  ^nil
]
```

---

## Control Flow

### Conditionals

```smalltalk
(x > 0) ifTrue: ["positive"] ifFalse: ["negative"]

(x isNil) ifTrue: ["nil"]
```

### Loops

```smalltalk
# Times repeat
5 timesRepeat: [Stdout writeline: "Hello"]

# To:do:
1 to: 10 do: [:i | Stdout writeline: i]

# To:by:do:
10 to: 1 by: -1 do: [:i | Stdout writeline: i]

# While
[condition] whileTrue: [body]
[condition] whileFalse: [body]

# Repeat
[body] repeat           # Infinite loop
[body] repeat: 5        # Repeat N times
```

### Iteration

```smalltalk
# Do: - iterate over collection
collection do: [:each | each print]

# Collect: - transform each element
collection collect: [:each | each * 2]

# Select: - filter elements
collection select: [:each | each > 5]

# Detect: - find first matching
collection detect: [:each | each > 5]

# Inject:into: - fold/reduce
[1, 2, 3, 4] inject: 0 into: [:sum :each | sum + each]
```

---

## Exception Handling

Harding provides exception handling through the `on:do:` mechanism:

### Basic Syntax

```smalltalk
[ protectedBlock ] on: ExceptionClass do: [ :ex | handlerBlock ]
```

Example:
```smalltalk
[ "Hello" / 3 ] on: Error do: [ :ex |
    Transcript showCr: "Error occurred: " + ex message
]
```

### Exception Objects

When caught, exception objects have:
- `message` - The error message string
- `stackTrace` - String representation of the call stack

```smalltalk
[ riskyOperation ] on: Error do: [ :ex |
    Transcript showCr: "Message: " + ex message.
    Transcript showCr: "Stack: " + ex stackTrace
]
```

### Raising Exceptions

Use `error:` to raise an exception:

```smalltalk
someCondition ifTrue: [
    Error error: "Something went wrong"
]
```

### Differences from Smalltalk

| Feature | Harding | Smalltalk |
|---------|------|-----------|
| Implementation | Built on Nim exceptions | Custom VM mechanism |
| Stack unwinding | Immediate (Nim default) | Immediate |
| Resume capability | No | Yes |

Harding trades Smalltalk's advanced features (resumable exceptions) for seamless integration with Nim's ecosystem.

---

## Libraries and Namespaces

Harding provides a Library class for organizing code into isolated namespaces. Libraries allow you to group related classes and avoid polluting the global namespace.

### Creating Libraries

```smalltalk
# Create a new library
MyLib := Library new.

# Add bindings (classes, constants, etc.)
MyLib at: "MyClass" put: SomeClass.
MyLib at: "Constant" put: 42.

# Retrieve bindings
MyLib at: "Constant"           # Returns 42
MyLib includesKey: "MyClass"   # Returns true
MyLib keys                     # Returns array of all binding names
```

### Loading Code into Libraries

The `Library>>load:` message loads a file and captures new global definitions into the library's bindings, rather than polluting the global namespace:

```smalltalk
# mylib.hrd - defines classes like MyClass, UtilityClass, etc.
MyLib := Library new.
MyLib load: "mylib.hrd"

# The classes from mylib.hrd are in MyLib's bindings
MyLib at: "MyClass"             # Returns the class
MyLib at: "UtilityClass"        # Returns the class

# They are NOT in the global namespace
Harding includesKey: "MyClass"  # Returns false
```

### Importing Libraries

Import a library to make its bindings accessible for name resolution:

```smalltalk
MyLib := Library new.
MyLib load: "mylib.hrd"
Harding import: MyLib

# Now classes from MyLib are accessible by name
Instance := MyClass new.
Value := UtilityClass doSomething.
```

### Variable Lookup Order

When resolving a variable name, Harding searches in this order:

1. **Local scope** (temporaries, captured variables, method locals)
2. **Instance variables** (slots on `self`)
3. **Imported Libraries** (most recent first)
4. **Global table** (fallback)

**Important**: Each method activation has its own isolated local scope. Methods cannot see the local variables of their calling method (unlike some dynamic languages). This prevents accidental coupling and ensures proper encapsulation.

Most recently imported libraries take precedence for conflict resolution:

```smalltalk
Lib1 := Library new.
Lib1 at: "SharedKey" put: 1.

Lib2 := Library new.
Lib2 at: "SharedKey" put: 2.

Harding import: Lib1.
Harding import: Lib2.

SharedKey  # Returns 2 (Lib2 was imported last)
```

### The Standard Library

The Standard Library is pre-loaded with common classes and utilities:

```smalltalk
Standard load: "lib/core/Collections.hrd"      # Set
Standard load: "lib/core/Interval.hrd"         # Interval
Standard load: "lib/core/Exception.hrd"        # Exception hierarchy
```

The Standard Library is automatically imported at startup, so these classes are accessible by default:

```smalltalk
Set new                # Set collection (from Standard)
1 to: 10               # Interval (from Standard)
Error error: "oops"    # Exception class (from Standard)
```

### Loading Code into Global Scope

To load code directly into the global namespace (for method extensions, etc.):

```smalltalk
 Harding load: "lib/core/Object.hrd"
```

This is used in `lib/core/Bootstrap.hrd` to load core method extensions before loading new classes into the Standard Library.

---

## Green Threads and Processes

Harding supports cooperative green processes:

### Forking Processes

```smalltalk
# Fork a new process
process := Processor fork: [
    1 to: 10 do: [:i |
        Stdout writeline: i
        Processor yield
    ]
]
```

### Process Control

```smalltalk
# Process introspection
process pid               # Process ID
process name              # Process name
process state             # State: ready, running, blocked, suspended, terminated

# Process control
process suspend
process resume
process terminate

# Yield current process
Processor yield
```

### Process States

- `ready` - Ready to run
- `running` - Currently executing
- `blocked` - Blocked on synchronization
- `suspended` - Suspended for debugging
- `terminated` - Finished execution

### Current Status

**Implemented:**
- Basic process forking with `Processor fork:`
- Explicit yield with `Processor yield`
- Process state introspection (pid, name, state)
- Process control (suspend, resume, terminate)
- Shared globals via `Harding` GlobalTable for inter-process communication

**Synchronization Primitives:**
- Monitor - Mutual exclusion with condition variables
- SharedQueue - Producer-consumer communication
- Semaphore - Counting and binary locks

See examples in lib/core/Monitor.hrd, lib/core/SharedQueue.hrd, and lib/core/Semaphore.hrd

All processes share the same globals and class hierarchy, enabling inter-process communication.

---

## Primitives

Harding provides a unified syntax for direct primitive invocation.

### Unified Syntax

Both declarative and inline forms use the same keyword message syntax:

```smalltalk
# No arguments
<primitive primitiveClone>

# One argument
<primitive primitiveAt: key>

# Multiple arguments
<primitive primitiveAt: key put: value>
```

### Declarative Form

Use `<<primitive>>` as the entire method body when a method's sole purpose is to invoke a primitive. Argument names in the primitive tag MUST match the method parameter names exactly, in the same order.

```smalltalk
# No arguments
Object>>clone <primitive primitiveClone>

# One argument - parameter name 'key' must match
Object>>at: key <primitive primitiveAt: key>

# Multiple arguments - parameter names must match
Object>>at: key put: value <primitive primitiveAt: key put: value>
```

### Inline Form

Use `<<primitive>>` within a method body when you need to execute Harding code before or after the primitive call. Arguments can be any variable reference: method parameters, temporaries, slots, or computed values.

```smalltalk
# Validation before primitive
Array>>at: index [
  (index < 1 or: [index > self size]) ifTrue: [
    self error: "Index out of bounds: " + index asString
  ].
  ^ <primitive primitiveAt: index>
]

# Using temporary variable
Object>>double [
  | temp |
  temp := self value.
  ^ <primitive primitiveAt: #value put: temp * 2>
]
```

### Benefits

1. **Single syntax to learn** - No confusing distinction between `primitive:>` and `primitive`
2. **Explicit arguments** - Arguments are visible in both declarative and inline forms
3. **Consistent with Smalltalk** - Uses keyword message syntax everywhere
4. **Better validation** - Argument names and counts are validated for declarative forms
5. **More efficient** - Bypasses `perform:` machinery

### Validation Rules

For declarative primitives:
- Argument names in the primitive tag must match method parameter names exactly
- Argument order must match parameter order
- Argument count must match the number of colons in the primitive selector

## Smalltalk Compatibility

### Syntactic Differences

#### Statement Separation

**Smalltalk:**
```smalltalk
x := 1.
y := 2.
```

**Harding:**
```smalltalk
x := 1.
y := 2.
# OR
x := 1
y := 2
```

#### String Literals

**Smalltalk:**
```smalltalk
'Hello World'       "Single quotes"
```

**Harding:**
```smalltalk
"Hello World"       "Double quotes only"
```

**Note**: Single quotes are reserved for future use.

#### Comments

**Smalltalk:**
```smalltalk
"Double quotes for comments"
```

**Harding:**
```smalltalk
# Hash for comments
```

### Semantic Differences

#### No Metaclasses

**Smalltalk:** Every class is an instance of a metaclass.

**Harding:** Classes are objects, but there are no metaclasses. Class methods are stored directly on the class object.

```smalltalk
# Instance method
Person>>greet [ ^ "Hello" ]

# Class method (no metaclass needed)
Person class>>newPerson [ ^ self new ]
```

#### Multiple Inheritance

Harding supports multiple inheritance with conflict detection, unlike Smalltalk's single inheritance.

```smalltalk
Child := Object derive: #(x)
Child addParent: Parent1
Child addParent: Parent2
```

#### Primitives

**Smalltalk:** Primitives are VM-specific numbered operations.

**Harding:** Primitives embed Nim code directly using unified syntax.

```smalltalk
Object>>at: key <primitive primitiveAt: key>
```

#### nil as UndefinedObject

**Smalltalk:** `nil` is a special primitive value.

**Harding:** `nil` is a singleton instance of `UndefinedObject`:

```smalltalk
nil class           # Returns UndefinedObject
nil isNil           # Returns true
```

### Compiler (Granite)

Harding includes a compiler called Granite that can build Harding applications into native binaries:

```smalltalk
# Create an application
MyApp := Application derive: #().
MyApp>>main: args [
    Stdout writeLine: "Hello from compiled app!".
    Stdout writeLine: ("2 + 3 = ", (2 + 3) asString).
    ^0
].

# Build it
app := MyApp new.
app name: "myapp".
Granite build: app
```

The compiler:
- Collects transitive class dependencies
- Generates Nim code from Harding AST
- Compiles method bodies to Nim procedures
- Compiles to native binary using Nim compiler

**Note:** The `main: args` method accepts an array parameter, but command-line arguments from the OS are not yet passed (currently receives empty array).

Build with granite support:
```bash
nim c -d:granite -o:harding_granite src/harding/repl/harding.nim
```

### Missing Features

Several Smalltalk-80 features are not implemented:

1. **Class Variables** - Use globals or closures as workarounds
2. **Class Instance Variables** - Not implemented
3. **Pool Dictionaries** - Use global tables or symbols
4. **Method Categories** - Methods stored in flat table
5. **Change Sets** - File-based source with git
6. **Refactoring Tools** - Basic text editing only
7. **Debugger** - Basic error messages only

## Grammar Reference

### Precedence and Associativity

| Precedence | Construct | Associativity |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| 1 (highest) | Primary expressions (literals, `()`, blocks) | - |
| 2 | Unary messages | Left-to-right |
| 3 | Binary operators | Left-to-right |
| 4 | Keyword messages | Right-to-left (single message) |
| 5 (lowest) | Cascade (`;`) | Left-to-right |

### Operators

```smalltalk
# Binary operators
3 + 4            # Addition
5 - 3            # Subtraction
x * y            # Multiplication

## Collections

### Arrays

```smalltalk
# Create array
arr := #(1 2 3)
arr := Array new: 5     # Empty array with 5 slots

# Access (1-based indexing)
arr at: 1               # First element
arr at: 1 put: 10       # Set first element

# Methods
arr size                # Number of elements
arr add: 4              # Append element
arr join: ","           # Join with separator
```

### Tables (Dictionaries)

```smalltalk
# Create table
dict := #{"key" -> "value", "foo" -> "bar"}

# Access
dict at: "key"
dict at: "newKey" put: "newValue"

# Methods
dict keys               # All keys
dict includesKey: "key" # Check if key exists
```
