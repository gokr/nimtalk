## Historical and Research Documents

The [`research/`](research/) directory contains historical design documents, implementation plans, and proposals. These documents are kept for reference but may not reflect the current implementation.

When in doubt, consult the user documentation above rather than research documents.

## Contributing to Documentation

- Keep user-facing documentation current with implementation changes
- Add research documents to `research/` subdirectory
- Follow the style guidelines in [../CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)
