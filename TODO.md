# Nimtalk Development TODO

This document tracks current work items, future directions, and known issues for Nimtalk development.

## Current Status Summary

**Project Structure**: ✅ Completed
- Source code under `src/` (Nim standard layout)
- Binary names: `ntalk` (interpreter/REPL), `ntalkc` (compiler)
- Build system updated with `build.nims` automation

**Core Language**: ✅ **Mostly Complete!**
- ✅ Lexer and parser with data structure literal syntax
- ✅ Prototype object system with slots and prototype chains
- ✅ Dictionary prototype for property bag objects
- ✅ AST interpreter core with message sending and block evaluation
- ✅ REPL/Interpreter with file execution and interactive mode
- ✅ Slot-based instance variable system (**fully implemented, 149x performance improvement**)
- ✅ Native method dispatch from Nimtalk code
- ✅ Method tables using canonical Symbols for identity-based lookup
- ✅ Base library with core objects and collections
- ✅ **Lexical closures with environment capture, MutableCell shared state, and non-local returns**
- ✅ Cascade syntax (`;` operator) for multiple messages to same receiver
- ✅ `>>` method definition syntax (parser support complete)
- ✅ `self` and `super` keywords for method dispatch
- ⏳ Compiler infrastructure (stub implementation - next major priority)

## High Priority Tasks

### 1. Compiler Implementation
- [ ] Complete method compilation from AST to Nim procedures
- [ ] Generate proper Nim type definitions for ProtoObject
- [ ] Implement symbol export for compiled methods
- [ ] Create actual `ntalkc` functionality (currently stub)

### 2. FFI Integration
- [ ] Implement Nim type marshaling system
- [ ] Create FFI bridge for calling Nim functions from Nimtalk
- [ ] Support Nim module imports in Nimtalk
- [ ] Type conversion utilities (`asNim:`, `fromNim:`)

### 3. Language Features
- [x] Instance variable type system and core implementation (types.nim, objects.nim)
- [x] Instance variable declaration syntax (`derive: #(#ivar1 #ivar2)` - implemented as message)
- [x] Instance variable access via automatic getters/setters (automatically generated)
- [x] **Lexical closures with environment capture, MutableCell shared state, and non-local returns**
- [x] Cascade syntax (`;` operator) for multiple messages to same receiver
- [x] Method definition syntax (`>>`) for files and REPL (parser support completed)
- [x] `super` support for calling parent methods
- [x] `self` keyword for receiver reference and dynamic dispatch
- [x] Block temporaries syntax `[ | temp1 temp2 | body ]`
- [ ] Enhanced control flow (loops, conditionals)

## Medium Priority Tasks

### 4. Standard Library Objects
- [x] Basic collection types (Array, Dictionary equivalents) - `at:` method implemented for array/table access
- [x] String concatenation with comma (`,`) operator
- [ ] Number objects with arithmetic operations
- [ ] String objects with additional manipulation methods
- [ ] Boolean objects with conditional logic

### 5. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Method caching for faster message lookup
- [ ] AST optimization passes
- [ ] Compiler optimizations for generated Nim code
- [ ] Memory management improvements

### 6. Tooling Enhancement
- [ ] Enhanced REPL with history and completion
- [x] Better error messages and debugging support
- [x] AST inspection with `--ast` flag
- [x] Execution tracing with `--loglevel DEBUG`
- [x] Programmatic logging control (`configureLogging()`, `setLogLevel()`)
- [ ] Syntax highlighting definitions for editors
- [ ] Build system improvements

## Future Directions

### 7. BitBarrel Integration
- [ ] First-class barrel objects in language
- [ ] Transparent persistence for Nimtalk objects
- [ ] Integration with existing BitBarrel Nim library
- [ ] Crash recovery and compaction support

### 8. Language Evolution
- [ ] Optional static type checking
- [ ] Module and namespace system
- [ ] Concurrency model using Nim's threading
- [ ] Metaprogramming and reflection APIs

## Known Issues & Bugs

### Build System
- [x] Binaries may appear in source tree (`nimtalk/repl/ntalk`) or root directory (both locations supported)
- [x] Clean task in `build.nims` uses shell commands to avoid NimScript restrictions
- [x] `nimble local` copies binaries to root directory for convenience (renamed from `setup` to avoid clash)
- [ ] Need consistent binary output location (Nimble default behavior)

### Language Implementation
- [ ] Parser edge cases with nested blocks and literals
- [ ] Memory management for circular references
- [ ] Error handling and recovery in interpreter
- [ ] Test coverage gaps in edge cases

## Documentation Needs

### User Documentation
- [x] README.md with getting started guide and examples (updated)
- [x] Design documents for slot-based instance variable system (docs/)
- [x] Debugging and tools documentation (docs/TOOLS_AND_DEBUGGING.md)
- [x] Closure implementation documentation (docs/closures.md)
- [ ] Complete language specification (SPECIFICATION.md missing)
- [ ] Tutorials and comprehensive examples
- [ ] API reference for built-in objects
- [ ] Help text improvements (ntalk and ntalkc)

### Developer Documentation
- [x] Architecture and design documents (docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md, docs/NIMTALK-NEW-OBJECT-MODEL.md)
- [x] Contribution guidelines (CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [x] Build and deployment instructions (README.md, build.nims)
- [ ] Internal API documentation
- [ ] Code documentation coverage

## Testing & Quality

### Test Coverage
- [x] Expand test suite for parser edge cases
- [x] Add integration tests for complete examples (test_derive_from_nimtalk.nim)
- [x] Add comprehensive evaluator tests (test_evaluator.nim - 23KB test suite)
- [x] Performance benchmarks (benchmark_slots.nim - 149x speedup)
- [x] Cross-platform testing (basic Nim portability tests)

### Code Quality
- [ ] Remove unused imports and variables (current warnings)
- [ ] Fix shadowed `result` variables
- [ ] Standardize error handling patterns
- [ ] Improve code documentation coverage
