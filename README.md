# Nimtalk

Smalltalk semantics, Nim performance, modern tooling.

Nimtalk is a class-based Smalltalk dialect that compiles to Nim. It preserves Smalltalk's message-passing syntax and live programming feel while adding native compilation, Nim ecosystem access, and familiar Unix tooling.

## Quick Example

```smalltalk
#!/usr/bin/env ntalk

"Create a class with instance variables"
Point := Object derive: #(x y).

"Add a method using >> syntax"
Point>>moveBy: dx and: dy [
    x := x + dx.
    y := y + dy.
    self
].

"Create an instance and use it"
p := Point new.
p x: 100 y: 200.
p moveBy: 10 and: 20.
p x  "Returns 110"
```

## For Smalltalkers

**What feels familiar:**

- Message syntax is identical: unary `obj size`, binary `3 + 4`, keyword `dict at: key put: value`
- String concatenation with comma: `'Hello' , ' World'`
- Blocks work as expected: `[:x | x * 2]` with proper lexical scoping and non-local returns
- Everything is an object, everything happens via message sends
- Live evaluation in the REPL: `ntalk` gives you an interactive prompt
- Familiar collection messages: `do:`, `select:`, `collect:`, etc

**What's different:**

| Smalltalk | Nimtalk |
|-----------|---------|
| Classes define structure | Classes derive from parents: `Object derive: #(ivars)` |
| Instance variables declared in class | Declare in class with `derive: #(x y)`, inherited by subclasses |
| Methods compiled to method dictionary | Methods stored in class tables, inherited via merged lookup |
| Image-based persistence | Source files, git, normal Unix workflow |
| VM execution | Compiles to Nim, then to native code |
| FFI via C bindings | Direct Nim interop: call Nim functions, use Nim types |

**The class system:**

Classes inherit from parent classes and instances are created via `new`:

```smalltalk
"Create a class with automatic accessors for x and y"
Point := Object derive: #(x y).

"Add methods using >> syntax"
Point>>printString [
    ^ '(' + (x asString) + ', ' + (y asString) + ')'
].

"Create an instance"
p := Point new.
p x: 42.
p y: 99.
p printString  "Returns '(42, 99)'"
```

Instance variables declared with `derive:` are stored in slots (fast array access). Classes have merged method tables for fast O(1) lookup. The `derive:` syntax creates a class and generates accessor methods `x`, `x:`, `y`, `y:`. Classes track subclasses for efficient method invalidation when methods change.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gokr/nimtalk.git
cd nimtalk
nimble build
nimble local   # Copies binaries to current directory
```

Binaries: `ntalk` (REPL/interpreter), `ntalkc` (compiler stub)

## Usage

```bash
ntalk                    # Interactive REPL
ntalk script.nt          # Run a file
ntalk -e "3 + 4"         # Evaluate expression
ntalk --ast script.nt    # Show AST, then execute
ntalk --loglevel DEBUG   # Verbose execution trace

ntalkc compile file.nt   # Compile to Nim
ntalkc run file.nt       # Compile and run
```

### Debugging

Use `--loglevel DEBUG` for detailed execution tracing, or control logging programmatically in tests:

```nim
import nimtalk/core/types
configureLogging(lvlError)  # Suppress debug output
```

## Language Basics

**Literals:**
```smalltalk
42 "integer"
3.14 "float"
'hello' "string"
#(1 2 3) "array (seq)"
#{'key' -> 'value'} "table (dictionary)"
{| x: 1 y: 2 |} "object literal"
```

**Assignment and messages:**
```smalltalk
x := 42.
obj := Object derive.
obj at: 'foo' put: 'bar'.
obj at: 'foo'.
```

**Blocks and control flow:**
```smalltalk
[:param | param + 1] "block with parameter"

(x > 0) ifTrue: ['positive'] ifFalse: ['negative'].
numbers do: [:each | each print].
```

## Current Status

Working:
- Lexer, parser, AST interpreter
- Prototype object system with property bags and slot-based instance variables
- REPL with file execution
- **Block closures with lexical scoping, environment capture, and non-local returns**
- **Closure variable isolation (independent counter instances)**
- **Sibling block variable sharing (multiple closures accessing shared state)**
- Data structure literals (arrays, tables, object literals)
- Method definition syntax (`>>`) for cleaner method declarations
- `self` and `super` support for method dispatch
- Base library (collections, core objects)
- **All 47 tests passing** ✅

**New:** Full Smalltalk-style closures are now implemented with proper variable isolation and sharing! See [docs/closures.md](docs/closures.md) for details.

In progress:
- Compiler to Nim (basic infrastructure in place)
- FFI to Nim
- Standard library expansion

## Architecture

Nimtalk uses a dual execution model:

1. **Interpreter**: AST evaluation for REPL and rapid prototyping
2. **Compiler**: Translates Nimtalk to Nim source, then compiles to native binaries

The interpreter provides full Smalltalk semantics. The compiler (in development) will enable deployment as native single binary executables with better performance.

## Differences from Standard Smalltalk

**Syntax additions:**
- `#( )` array literals (like Smalltalk, but maps to Nim `seq`)
- `#{ }` table literals (key-value dictionaries, maps to Nim `table`)
- `{| |}` object literals (property bags)
- `# comment` (Nim-style comments, in addition to `"comments"`)

**Collections:**
Uses Nim's data structures directly: `seq` instead of `OrderedCollection`, `Table` instead of `Dictionary`. The literal syntax is familiar but the underlying types are Nim's high-performance implementations.

**No images:**
Nimtalk uses source files and compiles to native binaries. You use git, your regular editor, and standard build tools. The REPL provides live evaluation during development, but persistence is through source code.
