# Harding

Harding is a Smalltalk dialect written in Nim that preserves most of the distinguishing features of the Smalltalk language while fitting in with modern tooling and strong abilities to integrate with libraries from the Nim and C ecosystems. The language currently has a stackless AST based interpreter supporting green threads in classic Smalltalk style.

## Quick Example

```smalltalk
"Hello, World!" println

# Class with automatic accessors
Person := Object deriveWithAccessors: #(name age)
p := Person new
p name: "Alice"
p age: 30
("Hello, " , p name) println

# Class with manual method definition
Point := Object deriveWithAccessors: #(x y)
Point>>distanceFromOrigin [ ^ ((x * x) + (y * y)) sqrt ]

p := Point new
p x: 3; y: 4
p distanceFromOrigin println  # Prints: 5.0
```

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gokr/harding.git
cd harding
nimble harding  # Build harding REPL
nimble bona     # Build bona IDE (optional)
```

Binaries:
- `harding` - REPL/interpreter
- `harding_debug` - REPL with debugger support
- `harding-lsp` - Language Server for IDE support
- `granite` - Compiler to Nim
- `bona` - GTK IDE

### IDE Desktop Integration (Ubuntu/GNOME)

For proper dock and Alt-Tab icons:

```bash
nimble install_bona  # Installs .desktop file and icon
```

## Usage

### REPL

```bash
harding                    # Interactive REPL
harding script.hrd         # Run a file
harding -e "3 + 4"         # Evaluate expression
harding --ast script.hrd   # Show AST, then execute
harding --loglevel DEBUG   # Verbose execution trace
```

### GTK IDE (Bona)

Launch the graphical IDE:

```bash
bona                       # Start IDE with Launcher
```

**IDE Tools:**
- **Launcher** - Main window with access to all tools
- **Workspace** - Code editor with Do It (Ctrl+D), Print It (Ctrl+P), Inspect It (Ctrl+I)
- **Transcript** - Output console for logging and results
- **System Browser** - Browse classes by library (Core, Collections, GUI, IDE)
- **Inspector** - Examine object slots and values

### Script Execution

Script files are automatically wrapped in a block, enabling Smalltalk-style temporary variable declarations:

```smalltalk
# script.hrd
| counter total |
counter := 0
total := 0
1 to: 5 do: [:i |
  counter := counter + 1
  total := total + i
]
total  # Returns 15
```

Scripts execute with `self = nil`, following the Smalltalk workspace convention.

### Environment Variables

- `HARDING_HOME` - Default home directory for loading libraries

### VSCode Extension

Full IDE support for `.hrd` files with syntax highlighting, completions, and debugging:

```bash
# Build the extension
nimble vsix

# Install
code --install-extension vscode-harding/vscode-harding-0.4.0.vsix
```

**Features:**
- Syntax highlighting
- Code completions (LSP)
- Hover information (LSP)
- Go to definition (LSP)
- Breakpoints and stepping (DAP)
- Variable inspection (DAP)

See [VSCODE.md](docs/VSCODE.md) for full details.

## For Smalltalkers

**What feels familiar:**

- Message syntax: unary `obj size`, binary `3 + 4`, keyword `dict at: key put: value`
- Cascade messages
- Classes and class methods
- String concatenation with comma: `"Hello" , " World"`
- Blocks are proper lexical closures with temporaries and can do early returns: `[ | temp | temp := 1 ]`
- Everything is an object, everything happens via message sends
- Live evaluation in the REPL with `harding`
- Collection messages: `do:`, `select:`, `collect:`, etc.

**What's different:**

| Smalltalk | Harding |
|-----------|---------|
| Required period end-of-statement | Optional - newline or period both work |
| Double quotes for comments | Hash `#` for comments |
| Single quotes for strings | Double quotes for strings |
| Classes define structure via class definition | Class construction using derive: `Object derive: #(ivars)` |
| Manual accessor definition | Auto-generated accessors via `deriveWithAccessors:` |
| Image-based persistence | Source files loaded on startup, git friendly source format, normal Unix workflow |
| VM execution | Interprets AST directly, native compiler via Nim (in development) |
| FFI via C bindings | Direct Nim interop: call Nim functions, use Nim types |

### Variable Naming Rule

Harding distinguishes globals from locals by capitalization and enforces this in parsing:

| Type | Convention | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Globals (class names, global variables) | Uppercase first | `Point`, `MyGlobal` |
| Locals (instance variables, temporaries, parameters, block params) | Lowercase first | `temp`, `index`, `value` |

### Key Syntax Differences

| Feature | Harding Syntax |
|---------|----------------|
| Comments | `# This is a comment` |
| Strings | `"Double quotes only"` |
| Create subclass | `Point := Object derive: #(x y)` |
| Create with accessors | `Point := Object deriveWithAccessors: #(x y)` |
| Create instance | `p := Point new` |
| Define method | `Point>>move: dx [ ... ]` |
| Batch methods | `Point extend: [ self >> foo [ ... ] ]` |

## Current Status

**Working:**
- Lexer, parser, stackless AST interpreter
- Class-based object system with slots
- REPL with file execution
- Block closures with lexical scoping and support for early returns
- Data structure literals
- Method definition (`>>`), `self` and `super` support
- Multi-character operators (`==`, `//`, `<=`, `>=`, `~=`, `~~`)
- Standard library (Object, Boolean, Block, Number, Collections, String, Exception, TestCase)
- Green threads: `Processor fork:`, `Processor yield`
- Synchronization primitives: Monitor, SharedQueue, Semaphore
- Multiple inheritance with conflict detection and scoped super send
- Dynamic message sending: `perform:`, `perform:with:`
- Automatic accessor generation: `deriveWithAccessors:`, `derive:getters:setters:`
- Library/namespace system for modular code organization (Core, Collections, GUI, IDE libraries)
- String concatenation with auto-conversion using `,`
- GTK-based IDE (`bona`) with Workspace (code editor with Do It/Print It/Inspect It), Transcript (output console), System Browser (class/method browser), and Inspector (object viewer)
- Smalltalk-style Print It - insert results in editor with selection
- Exception handling via `on:do:` with proper stack unwinding
- Compiler infrastructure (`granite`) with inline control flow compilation
- Granite compiles standalone `.hrd` scripts to native binaries via Nim
- Inline compilation of `ifTrue:`, `ifFalse:`, `ifTrue:ifFalse:`, `whileTrue:`, `whileFalse:`, `timesRepeat:`
- Compiled code runs 30-200x faster than interpreted (benchmark: sieve of Eratosthenes)
- BitBarrel integration: persistent key-value storage with `BarrelTable` and `BarrelSortedTable` classes
- Version-based MIC/PIC caching for improved message send performance
- All 26 test files passing with zero failures
- VSCode extension with LSP (completions, hover, symbols) and DAP (breakpoints, stepping, variables)
- Harding Debug Protocol (HDP) for VM debugging

**In progress:**
- Compiler to Nim: first-class blocks with captures, non-local returns
- FFI to Nim
- Standard library expansion
