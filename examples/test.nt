# Nimtalk canonical test
# "The canonical test for Smalltalk is calculating 3 + 4 and writing the answer on stdout."
#

# For now, just prove we can run and output something
# In a full implementation, this would be:
#   result := 3 add: 4
#   Transcript show: result

# Instead, we'll use properties to demonstrate basic functionality
result := Object derive
result at: "value" put: 7

# For now, just return the value as a property
result value
